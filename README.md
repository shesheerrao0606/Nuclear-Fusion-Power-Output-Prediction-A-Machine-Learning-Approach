# Nuclear Fusion Power Output Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the power output of nuclear fusion experiments using machine learning techniques. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 100,000 rows of experimental data from nuclear fusion trials, with 19 columns representing various parameters. Key features include:

- Magnetic field fluctuations
- Plasma instabilities
- Injection energy
- Target density
- Temperature
- Confinement time

The target variable is Power Output.

## Objectives
- Build a regression model to predict power output based on input parameters
- Identify key factors influencing fusion reaction success
- Optimize power generation process

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. Model evaluation and optimization
